\chapter{\sffamily {What are the Advantages}}
\large{\sffamily{
There are some major advantages of using Meet@Nsu, which will give Nsu students(Nsuers) easier and more safe platform to interact with each other. We would like to present them by the following points:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Only for University students: Mostly There is no appropriate social media platform available to university students where they can communicate with other students just on campus. Some university students are unable to form their ideal friendship network or buddies as a result of the open credit system, which causes them to remain introverted.Although we need to be a little extrovert to survive in the business world. Our Meet@Nsu can be useful in this situation. We are working to provide them with a suitable social media platform so they may become more outgoing and open-minded and do better in their professional lives as well. We hope that since there won't be any outsiders (non-university students), students will maintain the platform clean, unlike other social media. This serves as a platform to connect the nation's youth and bring them together.\\


\item Security: We made every effort to create our platform the most safe social media site for university students. We three shall keep an eye on everything (Authors). And we'll work to maximize the platform's potential.

\item Mental Boost: Everyone was confined to their homes in 2019â€“2021 due to the epidemic and their dread of the Covid-19 virus. Most students become introverts as a result of the significant time gap between gatherings with friends and other people. Everything was online then. As a result, several individuals have yet to use the offline system. As a result, they are reluctant to approach others and introduce themselves. To solve the issue of their being introverts, we intend to encourage them to speak on our platform and then meet at campus. We believe the action we are taking will have a favorable outcome and will give the students the necessary mental boost to continue their academic careers profoundly.

\item Establishing a sense of community among all university students in the nation: We are launching the website with our University, North South University, first (NSU). Meet@Nsu is the resultant name. However, our long-term goal is to expand the community to include all university students across the nation, allowing students from various backgrounds to interact and become more effective. We intend to create other websites for various universities, including Meet@EWU, Meet@DU, Meet@AIUB, and others. There will be a premium edition available where students can explore more and engage with other university students.
